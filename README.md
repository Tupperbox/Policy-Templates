# Tupperbox Policy Templates

## About Our Project

On the 27th of April, 2016, the European Union published the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which went into effect on the 25h of May, 2018. This piece of legislation fundamentally altered the dynamic between tech companies and their users.

We at Tupperbox wholeheartedly believe in the vision of transparency and accountability outlined in the GDPR. We are users of apps and we value our privacy and consumer rights just as much as anyone else. This is why, when publishing our own Terms of Service and Privacy Policies, we decided to take an approach in drafting these policies that maximally aligns with the values enshrined in the GDPR, instead of just creating policies that maximally cover our asses.

Unfortunately, when searching for templates or products to help draft these policies, we found that the product space for legal drafting heavily favors ass-covering over establishing good faith symbiotic relationship with the consumer. Many of the policies we reviewed seemed far too legally dense, terse, or were just outright written with opposition of the consumer in mind. We felt these policies established a parasitic relationship with the consumer, and almost all of them seemed overreaching.

We were unsatisfied with the products on offer and decided to spend weeks drafting our own policies from scratch. We wanted to create approachable, easy to understand policies which aligned tightly with the spirit of consumer protections. Our hope is that these policies will serve to reassure our users that we are working with their rights and interests in mind. In many ways, the GDPR was the first big step in moving toward a brighter horizon, but unfortunately it also introduces a roadblock for small app creators who need to comply with their regulations.

Our goal with this project is hopefully to showcase and sponsor a different kind of landscape, where users may rest assured that the app creators they are entrusting their data to will use their data responsibly and transparently, and are willing to be held accountable for failures to advocate on the user's behalf.

Tupperbox is primarily a Discord bot, and as a Discord bot, much of the existing language surrounding these kinds of policies tends not to apply very well. Our policies are tailored to the Discord bot platform, and as such have a few unique provisions and structures that fellow bot developers might find uniquely useful.

## How to Use Our Project

Our policies are presented in the policies folder in markdown format under no copy restrictions whatsoever, as released by the CC0 license. You can convert the markdown text to html or another document format if needed.

The explicit objective of the Privacy Policy is to transparently outline how your app and company will use a user's data. If your app does not conform to the strict uses outlined in the Privacy Policy, you may be found to be in violation of your users' rights. Make sure that you are correctly and clearly outlining how your app uses a user's data.

The policies have been marked up with placeholders using `{{Placeholder}}` syntax, as well as comments using `<!-- comment -->` syntax. You should take care to ensure your final version of these policies have properly filled in or replaced & removed these before publishing them.

While you may use these policies however you like, we would advise that you consult with a legal professional regarding your own policies to fully understand the implications and protections therein, especially if you are receiving money from your users.
