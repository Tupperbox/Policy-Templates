# Terms of Service

These terms govern your use of the {{WebsiteName}} website and the {{AppName}} Discord bot, together referred to as the “Services”, provided by {{CompanyLegalName}} (“{{CompanyName}}”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).

In these terms, “you” and “your” refer to the natural person or legal entity using the Services. If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity and its affiliates to these terms, and hereafter “you” and “your” refers to that entity.

Please read these terms carefully. These terms are a legally binding contract between you and {{CompanyName}}. By using the Services in any way, you agree to all of these terms, and the agreement is effective as of the date your use of the Services begins. If you do not agree to the terms, you may not use or access the Services in any way.

Anyone who is a minor (as defined by your relevant jurisdiction) can only use the Services with the permission of your parent or legal guardian.

## Restrictions on Use of {{CompanyName}} Services

## Privacy Policy

We believe strongly in respecting the privacy rights of our users. No data is collected from any user unless they have previously registered data with the Services, or they are directly interacting with {{AppName}} (for example, using a command on Discord). Except as necessary for the operation of the Services, {{CompanyName}} does not collect your personal or identifying information. All collected data is only used to provide the Services and we do not share your data to third parties except as necessary to provide the Services (such as sending content to Discord). We do not sell your data. Please review our [privacy policy](/policy/privacy) to fully understand what data we collect and how it will be used.

## Content Policy

### Your Content

"Your Content" or just "Content" refers to any messages, text, links, images, videos, files, or other media transmitted by you through the Services, such as by uploading, posting, or sharing.

{{CompanyName}} assumes no ownership or responsibility over Your Content and we are not responsible or liable for how others use Your Content.

By submitting Content through the Services, you warrant and represent that the Content is lawful, that you have the right to share it, and that you have the right to grant us the licenses in the following section. You also acknowledge that Your Content may be displayed publicly, for example if you post it to a public Discord server or you otherwise elect to make the Content publicly available through the Services.

We reserve the right to refuse, restrict access to, or disable any of Your Content if it violates these terms or if we find it to be harmful to {{AppName}} or other users.

#### License to Process Your Content

In order to provide the Services, {{CompanyName}} needs a license from you to be able to process and transmit Your Content on your behalf to third parties like Discord. This license is not a claim of ownership and only allows us to do certain necessary things with Your Content in connection with providing the Services.

When you use the Services, you give us a license to:

- Use, copy, store, distribute, and communicate Your Content as necessary to provide the Services.
- Publish, publicly perform, or publicly display Your Content if you've made it visible to others.
- Monitor, modify, translate, and reformat Your Content.
- Sublicense Your Content to allow the Services to work as intended.

This license is worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, and perpetual.

You and/or your licensors shall retain all right, title and interest in all Content stored in the Service, including any revisions, updates or other changes made to such Content.

#### Excluded Data

You shall not provide {{AppName}} with any Content that is subject to heightened security requirements by law, regulation or contract \(examples include but are not limited to the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Child’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the standards promulgated by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI-DSS), and their international equivalents (collectively, “Excluded Data”). {{CompanyName}} shall have no responsibility or liability for Excluded Data.

### Third-Party Content

The Services may include links to Third-Party Content. This can include articles, photos, videos, music, software, and other materials.

We do not monitor or review Third-Party Content for accuracy or appropriateness. We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or any other aspect of Third-Party Content. If you access Third-Party Content, you do so at your own risk.

Inclusion of or linking to Third-Party Content does not mean we endorse or approve such content. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of {{CompanyName}}.

Any purchases made through third-party websites are between you and the third party. We do not take responsibility for these transactions and any issues that arise from them.

## Operation

### Data Loss

In the process of making updates and improvements to the Services a user's data may be lost or a part of the Services removed as part of these updates. If any user data may be lost as part of a planned update, we will plan to give appropriate notice in advance, so that users may make local copies if desired.

Corruptions, bugs, or other unforeseen events which cause data loss may happen that occur without our intent. We try to mitigate these events by keeping long-term backups of data, but it is unfortunately impossible to guarantee that data will not be lost, so we make no such guarantee.

In any case, you are solely responsible for the preservation of your data provided to {{CompanyName}} via the Services. We strongly recommend that you maintain your own copies of any data provided to us, as we cannot always guarantee that we will be able to return your data.

### Downtimes

On occasion, we will need to introduce planned service disruptions (or "downtimes") for maintenance purposes. In such cases, we intend to make use of available channels, such as the [support server]({{SupportServerLink}})'s \#announcements channel, to notify you in advance of these downtimes.

In other cases, unplanned downtimes may occur, intentional or otherwise. We try to minimize these as much as possible, but there will always be circumstances beyond our control which render the Services inaccessible.

We make no guarantee that the Services will be available at any given time. You should not rely on the Services for critical applications.

### Updates

We are continuously trying to improve the Services. In the process, changes may be made to the Services that alter existing functionality.

Any features or functions related to the Services which are not currently available, but are referenced on any {{CompanyName}} website, or in any verbal or electronic communications, may not be delivered on time or at all. The development, release, and timing of any features or functionality described for our products and services remains at our sole discretion.

If you decide to purchase one of our paid offerings, you agree that the purchase is based solely upon features and functions that are currently available as of the time of purchase, and not in expectation of any future feature or function.

## Term and Termination

### Requested Termination

<!-- You will need to provide a way for users to revoke consent from using your app.  When they do so you will need to remove any user data they've given you. -->

You may request deletion of your account data at any time by contacting us in the [support server]({{SupportServerLink}}) using the account for which you would like to request deletion. You are responsible for making sure any Content you wish to keep is saved before requesting deletion. Upon receipt of your request, we will delete all data associated with your account as soon as we are able, subject to our data retention and backup policies, and subject to applicable law.

Upon termination, any outstanding fees and charges you owe to us will remain due and payable.

### Our Right to Terminate

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services for any reason, including but not limited to:

- Violation of these Terms of Service
- Conduct that we believe is harmful to other users, our operation, or third parties
- Legal or regulatory reasons
- Extended periods of inactivity

We will attempt to provide notice of termination where possible, but we are not obligated to do so.

### Effect of Termination

If this agreement is terminated all of your rights to use the Services will terminate. Termination of your access to the Services may include removal of your data and preventing you from accessing any part of the Services, including any content you or others have submitted.

### Survival of Terms

Provisions of the following sections shall survive termination or expiration of these terms: Intellectual Property, Limitation of Liability, Indemnity, Governing Law, and any other provisions that by their nature should survive termination.

## Payment, Billing, and Taxes

{{CompanyName}}'s development and operation is paid for by users who opt to pay a subscription fee for access to certain features of the Services.

Should you decide to purchase a subscription, you agree to pay all fees and charges associated with the subscription for the duration that you choose to maintain the subscription.

**Payment:** We use third-party payment processors such as Stripe to transmit payments to us. We offer multiple methods of subscription such as through {{WebsiteName}}, Patreon, or Discord. Depending on which method you choose, your payment information and subscription renewal may be handled according to different terms. You are responsible for reviewing the policies of the platform you choose. In case of conflict, your chosen third-party payment processor's terms of service shall supersede these terms.

**Automatic Renewal:** By enrolling in a subscription, you authorize {{CompanyName}} to automatically charge your payment method at the beginning of each subscription period until the subscription is canceled. The date of this renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.

**Cancellation Policy:** You may cancel your subscription at any time. The method to cancel depends on the payment processor used to pay for your subscription. Upon cancellation, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period, after which it will not be renewed and you will not be charged further.

**Refund Policy:** Subscription fees are non-refundable, except where required by law or at our sole discretion. In general, we are happy to provide users with a one-month refund upon reasonable request, especially early in the subscription term. Our ability to issue refunds may be limited by your chosen payment processor. We reserve the right to refuse any refund requests.

**Changes to Fees:** We reserve the right to change our subscription fees at any time. Any changes to fees will be communicated to you in advance, and will apply to subsequent billing periods after the notice period.

**Taxes:** All fees are exclusive of taxes, levies, or duties, (“Taxes”), and unless you can provide a valid state sales/use/excise tax exemption certificate (or other reasonable evidence of exemption) to {{CompanyName}}, you will be responsible for payment of all such Taxes excluding taxes based solely on {{CompanyName}}’s income.

**Learn More:** To learn how to cancel your subscription, request a refund, or contact us regarding any other payment related issues on your chosen payment processor, [see our FAQ regarding payment issues]({{FAQPaymentLink}}).

## Intellectual Property

We do not claim ownership of any intellectual property posted by our users using the Services.

**Use of Aggregate Information:** {{CompanyName}} may collect, anonymize, and aggregate data derived from the operation of the Services (“Aggregated Data”), and {{CompanyName}} may use such Aggregated Data for purposes of operating {{CompanyName}}’s business, monitoring performance of the Services, and/or improving the Services. Aggregated Data belongs to {{CompanyName}}.

**Feedback:** You grant to {{CompanyName}} a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate into the Services any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations, or other information provided by you relating to the features, functionality or operation of the Services (“Feedback”). Feedback does not include Your Content. Notwithstanding any other term herein, Feedback shall not create any confidentiality obligation for {{CompanyName}}.

**Reservations of Rights:** Except for the limited rights expressly granted to you within these Terms, {{CompanyName}} reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services, the underlying software, and any and all improvements, modifications and updates to them (including any arising from Feedback), including without limitation all related intellectual property rights. No rights are granted to you other than as expressly set forth in these Terms. Nothing in these Terms will impair {{CompanyName}}’s right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote or distribute products, software or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with those you develop, produce, market, or distribute.

### Takedown Notice

If you believe that someone is using {{AppName}} to violate your intellectual property rights, use the process outlined below to issue a formal takedown notice.

Contact us at [{{CopyrightEmail}}](mailto:{{CopyrightEmail}}) or send a letter to:

Copyright Manager of {{CompanyMailingAddress}}

Your notice MUST include the following: (i) A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the copyright or intellectual property owner; (ii) A description of the work or works you believe have been infringed upon; (iii) An identification of the location of the material on our services you believe is infringing, including identifiers like URLs or other IDs, such that we can locate the material; (iv) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; (v) Your name and contact information, including mailing address, telephone number, and/or email address, such that we may contact you; (vi) Your physical or electronic signature.

Upon receipt of a valid takedown notice satisfying all of the above conditions, we will review and possibly remove the alleged infringing material. Repeated acts of infringement may be grounds for termination of access to the Services at our sole discretion.

### Counter-Notices

Upon receipt of a valid counter notice, it will be forwarded to the complaining party. The DMCA allows us to restore Your Content within 10-14 business days unless the copyright owner notifies us that they have filed a court action against you in that time.

## Dispute Resolution

We firmly believe in your consumer rights to seek resolution to issues with these terms as you please, so we won't force you to agree to an arbitration clause. Instead, we prioritize resolving issues amicably and transparently. If you encounter any problems arising from these terms, we ask that you contact us at [{{PolicyEmail}}](mailto:{{PolicyEmail}}), so we can work with you to find an agreeable resolution.

Any claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to these terms or their subject matter will be brought exclusively in <!-- Your Company's relevant legal jurisdiction --> , and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

No claim or action, regardless of form, arising out of these terms may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the earlier of the following:

- the expiration or termination of all Subscriptions,
- the termination of these terms, or
- the time a party first became aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the basis for the claim.

To the fullest extent permitted, each party waives the right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to these terms.
